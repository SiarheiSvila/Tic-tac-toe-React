# Tic-tac-toe React App

## Description:
2-player tic-tac-toe game

This application contains only one page that is actually a game itself. It displays who's turn is next/who is the winner and a button to restart game or play again.





## To run:
Download this repo, make sure `npm` and `nodejs` packages are installed on your computer.

Under the parent folder create a new called `node_modules` and put standart node modules files there. I hope, you are familiar with this :).

Navigate to the project's parent folder and run the command:
```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

## Usage and Screenshots:
So, you've started the application. Let's simulate a game process:
